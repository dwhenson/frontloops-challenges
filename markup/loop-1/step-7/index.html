					The past is always with us. Where we come from, what we go through, how we
					go through it; all this shit matters. Like at the end of the book, ya'
					know, boats and tides and all. It's like you can change up, right, you can
					say you're somebody new, you can give yourself a whole new story. But, what
					came first is who you really are and what happened before is what really
					happened. It don't matter that some fool say he different 'cause the things
					that make you different is what you really do, what you really go through.

					Like, ya' know, all those books in his library. He frontin' with all them
					books, but if you pull one down off the shelf, none of the pages have ever
					been opened. He got all them books, and he hasn't read nearly one of them.
					Gatsby, he was who he was, and he did what he did. And 'cause he wasn't
					willing to get real with the story, that shit caught up to him.
